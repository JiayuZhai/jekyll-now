This is **Wilbur Zhai** github blog. The name **翟佳羽 (ZHAI JIAYU)** in Chinese is useful in some cases.

I was studying in [School of Informatics](http://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics), [University of Edinburgh](http://www.ed.ac.uk/) for Master of Science (MSc) Degree in Computer Science starting from Sep 2017 to Sep 2018.

My Interesting Area in Computer Science is Natural Language Processing, Neural Machine Translation, Machine Learning Application, and Internet of Things Application.

I was doing my final project with the title of Generative Models for Generating Synthetic Social Data in the MSc stage from 2018 Spring to 2018 Summer. I was doing my final project with the title of Spark based Large Scale Social Network Directed Community Detection Algorithm in Distributed System in the undergraduate stage from 2016 Winter to 2017 Summer.
